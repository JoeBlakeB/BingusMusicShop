## List the third party libraries, frameworks, scripts, etc. that you used in your assignment:

I used some third party fonts from Google Fonts and icons from Font Awesome, the links to them are below. I also used a website to generate the code for the array of countries used in the address edit page. However, I did not use any third party frameworks other than the base languages, PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## What is the best part of your work?

I think the best part of my work is how it is structured, this is because I have made it to be fully object oriented and it uses the Model View Controller design pattern. This means that despite it being more complex, it is more maintainable than if it were just done procedurally.

## What is the weakest part of your work?

The weakest part of my system I think is my CSS and the design of the website. This is because I am not as good at the interface design as with the rest of the development process. However, I think that the design and layout is still good and readable and that it is responsive enough that it is usable on a variety of screen sizes.

## Which part of the assignment did you struggle with the most?

I struggled with making my system be fully object oriented at first as it was the first time I had done something like it and also because I started developing this as procedural and then had to convert it after deciding to use OOP after being taught it in the lectures and labs. I also struggled with the CSS and making the website look good and be responsive, I was able to get it to a point where I am happy with it but it took a while to do it.
